1 -> Straight up insert, requires name, definiton and will also add 1 to first line to specify 1 definition.
2 -> Splits into 2 cases: 1. Update a single definition.(Will be given as a parameter in the test cases)(update it,delete it,add a new one)
                          2. Update the entire word(clear the entire definition file and create a new one,which goes to case 1,add a new definiton)
3 -> Delete a word
4 -> Look-up a word and it's definitions.
