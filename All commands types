	Different type explanations:
	1 -> Straight up insert, requires name, definiton and will also add 1 to first line to specify 1 definition.
	2 -> Splits into 4 cases: 1. Update a single definition.(Will be given as a parameter in the test cases)
				  2. Clear the word definitions.
	                          3. Add a new definition for the respective word.
	                          4. Remove a single definiton.(Will be given as a parameter in the test cases)
	3 -> Look-up a word and show its definitions.

	How the file layout for each word will be:
	First line will represent the number of definitions our word has.(defnum)
	The next defnum lines will consist of strings where each one represents a definition for that word.
