\section{Problem statement}
(Team of 2) Write a dictionary application. The dictionary should allow for in-
serting a word, updating the definition of an existing word and looking up defi-
nition of a word. Note that a word may have multiple definitions attached to it.
The dictionary should use files for storing and loading its data. \linebreak
The alghorithm should be able to Insert a new word to the dictionary, Update a word from the dictionary
in multiple ways and Look-up and display a word's definitions.
\linebreak
\linebreak
This is how the input will be given in the test file:
	Different type explanations:
	\begin{enumerate}	\item Straight up insert, requires name, definiton and will also add 1 to first line to specify 1 definition.
		\item \begin{enumerate} \item[2.1] Update a single definition.(Will be given as a parameter in the test cases)
		\item[2.2] Clear the word definitions.
		\item[2.3] Add a new definition for the respective word.
		\item[2.4] Remove a single definiton.(Will be given as a parameter in the test cases) \end{enumerate}
		\item Look-up a word and show its definitions.\end{enumerate}

	
	How the file layout for each word will be:
	The name of the file will be the name of the word.
	First line will represent the number of definitions our word has.(defnum)
	The next defnum lines will consist of strings where each one represents a definition for that word.

\section{Application Design}

\begin{itemize}

\item
The high level architectural overview of the application.

\item
The Specification of the input.

\item
The Specification of the output.

\item
The list of all the modules in the application and their description.

\item
The list of all the functions in the application, grouped by modules.
\end{itemize}


\section{Conclusions}


\subsection{Achievements}
One thing we achieved during the development of the project is learning the high architectural level of the Red-Black Trees and their implementation in the set and how the set from the C++ algorithm STL library.

\subsection{Challenging and interesting	parts}
\sloppy
One of the interesting parts in the development process of the project was understanding the functions that we have already been using for a while but never really knew how their C implementation looked like.
\linebreak
 Another interesting part of the project was the learning of the different implementations and functions that come with the Red-Black trees.

\subsection{Future directions for extending the project}
One future direction for this project would be implementing it in a website
or even a mobile application and perhaps adopting a design similar to what Wikipedia does with its articles. Everyone would be able to insert or update a word as long as they provide a source that shows that the operation that they want to perform is valid and it gets approved by an administrator.
